The fragmented mRNA was subjected to cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II) and random primers. The cDNA was further converted into double stranded cDNA and, after an end repair process (Klenow fragment, T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 polymerase), was finally ligated to Illumina paired end (PE) adaptors. Size selection was performed using a 2% agarose gel, generating cDNA libraries ranging in size from 200–250 bp. Finally, the libraries were enriched using 15 cycles of PCR and purified by the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

In CTRL donors, approximately 100 mm2 of cortex were dissected. In AD tissues, four different regions of interest were dissected: ThioS+ plaques (approximately 1000/donor), the 50 ?m area around those ThioS+ plaques, ThioS+ NFTs with the 50 ?m area around them (approximately 1500/donor), and cortex far (> 50 ?m) from both ThioS+ plaques and NFTs (approximately 80–100 mm2)

 External RNA Controls Consortium RNA Spike?In Mixes (Ambion, Life Technologies) consisting of 92 poly?adenylated transcripts with known concentration were added to each RNA sample; and same reference sample was loaded in all plates

Sequencing quality control was performed with the FastQC (version 0.11.9) and MultiQC (version 1.9) software.

FeatureCounts (v1.6.5) was used to assign aligned reads to genes. Raw counts were log?transformed and trimmed mean of M values normalized. After removal of duplicate reads expected at high rates from low input RNA samples, downstream analysis was performed based on a mean library size of 10.72 M reads.


Differential expression analyses were conducted using the limma package in R, and the models used were based on prespecified hypotheses, as follows:

1. Transcriptomic differences between AD and CTRL donors are maximum within and around A? plaques and NFTs:
exp??0+?1?GMlocation+e,
where gray matter (GM) location is a categorical variable with CTRL cortex as reference, and “plaques,” “peri?plaque,” “tangle,” and “distant” as possible values.

2. A? plaques and NFTs are associated with distinct transcriptomic changes and the APOE genotype impacts the transcriptomic changes within and around A? plaques and NFTs in the AD brain. We ran two separate linear regression models:

a) A model to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by APOE genotype in each cortical location only in AD donors:
exp??0+?1?APOE+e,
where APOE is a binary variable with APOE ?3/?3 as reference (the single APOE ?3/?4 AD donor was excluded from this analysis).

b) A mixed?effects model to determine the effects of APOE genotype, cortical regions (i.e., location), and the interaction between the two:
exp??0+?1?APOE+?2?GMlocation+?3?APOE?GMlocation+e,
where APOE is a binary variable with APOE ?3/?3 as reference (the single APOE ?3/?4 AD donor was excluded from this analysis), GM location is a categorical variable with “distant” as reference, and “plaques,” “peri?plaque,” and “tangle” as possible values (CTRL donors are excluded from this analysis), and the interaction term APOE*GM location represents the difference between both APOE genotypes at each location relative to the “distant” one."

***An additional group of AD diagnosed patients with early Braak 3–4 neuropathology and cognitive decline was added to the NBB groups. (I think these were used only for RT-PCR validation, but it is not very clear to me in the text)

QuantSeq Tables of read counts per gene were generated from the alignments using the HTSEQ package.

QuantSeq The minimal sequence base quality value selected for further processing was 20 (Phred score).  Progressive alignment method was selected. Only primary alignments were considered for gene counts and quantification. The minimal identity seed for alignment extension was 25 nucleotides.

Square The automated SOLiD EZ Bead System and SOLiD EZ Bead E80 System Consumables (Life Technologies Corp.) were applied for the template preparation. The SOLiD 5500xl System and single-end chemistry for RNA sequencing was applied (Life Technologies Corp.).

Square Transcripts with > 1 read per kilobase per million (RPKM) per SQUARE field were defined as being detected, whereas any RPKM below 1 was considered as reflecting leakiness of the transcription. An average of 6610 ± 1367 genes per field were detected across the 12 fields"	Barbash et al.
